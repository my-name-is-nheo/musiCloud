                  The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an
                  n×n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

                      Chess composer Max Bezzel published the eight queens
                      puzzle in 1848. The problem can be quite computationally
                      expensive, as there are 4,426,165,368 (i.e., 64C8)
                      possible arrangements of eight queens on an 8×8 board, but
                      only 92 solutions. It is possible to use shortcuts that
                      reduce computational requirements or rules of thumb that
                      avoids brute-force computational techniques. For example,
                      just by applying a simple rule that constrains each queen
                      to a single column (or row), though still considered brute
                      force, it is possible to reduce the number of
                      possibilities to just 16,777,216 (that is, 88) possible
                      combinations. Generating permutations further reduces the
                      possibilities to just 40,320 (that is, 8!), which are then
                      checked for diagonal attacks. The eight queens puzzle has
                      92 distinct solutions. If solutions that differ only by
                      symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) of the
                      board are counted as one, the puzzle has 12 fundamental
                      solutions. A fundamental solution usually has eight
                      variants (including its original form) obtained by
                      rotating 90, 180, or 270° and then reflecting each of the
                      four rotational variants in a mirror in a fixed position.
                      However, should a solution be equivalent to its own 90°
                      rotation (as happens to one solution with five queens on a
                      5x5 board), that fundamental solution will have only two
                      variants (itself and its reflection). Should a solution be
                      equivalent to its own 180° rotation (but not to its 90°
                      rotation), it will have four variants (itself and its
                      reflection, its 90° rotation and the reflection of that).
                      It is not possible for a solution to be equivalent to its
                      own reflection (except at n=1) because that would require
                      two queens to be facing each other. (For n-queen problem's
                      solution to be equivalent to its own mirror-image
                      solution, the solution needs to be symmetrical by the
                      center of the board either horizontally or vertically.
                      Then, two queens would be facing each other, making it not
                      a solution. ) Of the 12 fundamental solutions to the
                      problem with eight queens on an 8x8 board, exactly one is
                      equal to its own 180° rotation, and none is equal to its
                      90° rotation; thus, the number of distinct solutions is
                      11*8 + 1*4 = 92 (where the 8 is derived from four 90°
                      rotational positions and their reflections, and the 4 is
                      derived from two 180° rotational positions and their
                      reflections). The different fundamental solutions are
                      presented below:
